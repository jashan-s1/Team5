Sep 19 : Afternoon Notes

### Why do we need Specification Documention?
- Document of problem statement
- Need to explain to large number of developers
- Useful for reference
- Notes don't document everything
- Common document for everyone to refer to
- Large projects; large spec docs
- Spec docs constantly updated

### SD Life Cycle
- Problem Definition (Skipped for the workshop)
- Requirement specification
- Design
- Code
- Test
- Future Enhancement

### Requirement Spec
- Document of solution statement

### What is Spec?
- Bring clarity to minds of development team
- Medium of communication

### Characteristic of requirement spec
- Accuracy
- Clarity
- Consistency
- Target Audience
- Readability
- Should not be ambigous
- Understandable

### Who needs requirement spec?
- Developers
- QA Engineers
- User Interface Designers / Uasbility Engineer
- Documentation Writer
- Customers 
- Marketing team
- Top management : Requirement analysis part 

### Contents of requirement spec
- Requirement Analysis
    - What problem we trying to solve?
    - (Problem statement)
- Functional Specification
    - How will system behave?
    - (Solution statement)
- External Interface
    - User interface
    - Communication Protocols
    - Hardware interface
    - Database backend
- Technical Specifications
    - Performance constraints
    - OS/Hardware 

[do not restrict your project to specific language or api]

### Requirement Analysis
- Define Problem to Solve
- Define the functions of application
- Define the userbase
    having a boundry makes it easier to define features
- Define success metrics
    when to decide if app is successful
- Is there something similar already available?
    if yes, what is the difference?

### Functional Specification
- Describe how the system will behave from user's perspective
- Scenario
    Define scenarios using real life personas
    Usage of our application  
    (Different personas for different use cases)
- System Overview
    Flowchart
- Spec is to communicate
- Use casual language


### External Interface Specification
- Describes how software interacts with other components
- External interfaces of Library management system
    - User Interface
    - Database Backend

### Technical Specification
- Part of Non Functional Requirements
- Hardware Interface
    processor, memory, storage, network
- Operating System
- Performance
    response time, throughput, latency
- Programming Language and Technologies (avoid, unless needed)
- Versions of various components (avoid, unless needed)

### Do we need tech specs for our project?
- It is ok to not define tech specs for our project at the start
- We can decided them on the go
- We can decide them based on the requirements
