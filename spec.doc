Introduction: 
Well, LMS is like your personal library. It helps keep track of all those things, so you can find what you want and borrow it hassle-free.
So, if you're a librarian, it helps you organize the library like a pro. And if you're someone who loves reading, it makes finding and borrowing books a breeze. No more hunting for hours or wondering when your books are due back.
LMS is all about making your library experience smooth and enjoyable. Let's dive in and see how it can improve your library adventures!

Purpose:
The purpose of a Library Management System (LMS) is to efficiently and effectively manage all aspects of a library's operations and resources. 
It also helps in managing & tracking the daily work of the library such as issuing books, return books, due calculations, etc. 
This software-based system is designed to streamline the processes involved in cataloguing, organizing, circulating, and maintaining a library's collection of books, digital media, periodicals, and other materials.

Requirement Analysis
We're aiming to solve several common challenges faced by libraries and library users such as:

1. Efficiency: Libraries often have a lot of books and materials to manage. Our project aims to make the process of cataloging, organizing, and lending these items more efficient for librarians.

2. Accessibility: Library users sometimes struggle to find the books they want or to know when they're due back. We're working to make it easier for people to find books and keep track of their borrowing.

3. Record Keeping: Managing records of borrowed and returned items can be a time-consuming task for librarians. Our project helps in automating this process, reducing the burden on library staff.

4. Communication: Libraries may find it challenging to notify users about due dates, overdue fines, or the availability of reserved books. We're creating a system that improves communication between libraries and users.
